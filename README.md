# Tel-Aviv-city-center_zoning-evaluation
Evaluation of two new zoning plans for Tel-Aviv city center; Markets, Design and the City class, NYU Wagner Spring 2018

## Research objective
Tel-Aviv recently (January 2018) approved a new zoning plan for one of its city center precincts, precinct no.3, or “The old North” neighborhood, and is about to approve a similar rezoning for the neighbor precinct no.4 (“The new North). The purpose of this research is to evaluate these two plans in terms of their feasibility and the future densities they would have formulate if fully implemented. This research attempts to assess whether the rezoning of these two precincts, although allowing more floor area to be built, is still restricting urban development or if the market will not demand the full utilization of urban densities as suggested in the plans.
